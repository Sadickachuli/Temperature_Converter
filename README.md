# features:
1. Allows the user to select either Fahrenheit-to-Celsius or Celsius-to-Fahrenheit conversions.
2. Uses the following formulae for conversion : °F = °C x 9/5 + 32   and °C = (°F - 32) x 5/9
3. Users can enter initial temperature values.
4. Pressing the Convert button calculates the converted temperature value and displays it on the screen out to 2 decimal places only.
5. The conversion operation, value, and calculated results are added to the “history”, where users can either show or hide it.
6. The app looks and act consistently in either portrait or landscape orientation.
